![Vifm](https://github.com/reybits/config-vifm/blob/master/vifm.png?raw=true)

## Description

This repository contains my custom Vifm configuration, designed to streamline file management while keeping things minimal and efficient. While I’m still exploring Vifm’s full potential, this setup refines several defaults to better suit my workflow.

For the best experience, use it alongside my [config-tmux](https://github.com/reybits/config-tmux.git) repository.

## Features

- Improved keybindings – Optimized shortcuts for faster navigation and file operations.
- Custom color scheme – A clean and readable interface for better visibility.
- Integration with external tools – Enhanced functionality with tmux, fzf, and other utilities.
-	Smart defaults – Tweaks to make Vifm more intuitive out of the box.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/reybits/vifm-config ~/.config/vifm
```

2. (Optional) Install dependencies for enhanced functionality (e.g., fzf, bat, ripgrep).
3. Restart Vifm and enjoy the improved experience!

Feel free to tweak the configuration to fit your own workflow. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!
